Simple Server converted from flat html+php to Symfony2


This is a search engine completely written by drunk people in 6 hours late one Saturday night in 2006.

It does all the work so you don't have to - it spiders the web, removes 'spammy' web sites and lets you search the basic keywords index. It completely follows the Keep It Simple Stupid principle. Especially in 6 hours.

The whole thing was completely written by:

    Dan Platt (Web Crawler)
    Alex Teugels (User Interface)
    Owen Gerrard (Asleep on the sofa)
    Sarah Quirke (Opening up a window of non-nagitude)

We're in a bit of a rush so I'll stop talking now. If you like it, support it!
